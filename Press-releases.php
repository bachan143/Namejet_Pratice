                           <p>Monday, April 29, 2019</p>
                           <h6 style=" font-style: italic;">With less than 700 in existence, two-letter domain names are rare and often worth millions of dollars. Notable past two-letter domain sales include $8 million for “we.com,” $5 million for “jd.com,” $4.8 million for “ig.com” and $3.2 million for “mi.com.” They are memorable, easy to type and break through language barriers. Just ask corporations like General Electric,
                              American Airlines and LG, which have built high-traffic websites on their two-letter domains.</h6>

                                    NameJet, the world’s leading domain name aftermarket platform, today announced “je.com” is available for bidding now through May 8, 2019.

These first and elite domains easily command high visibility across major search engines.

                                    “Offering an incredible two-letter domain name such as je.com is something we are very excited about,” said Jonathan Tenenbaum, general manager of NameJet. “NameJet’s award-winning aftermarket platform, combined with our leading domain investor network, gives us a great advantage in finding the right buyer for this highly valuable domain.”

                                    <h2>RightOfTheDot and NameJet® Drive Record-Breaking Sales at Annual NamesCon 2019 Live Auction</h2>
                                    <p>Friday, February 8, 2019</p>
                                    <h6  style=" font-style: italic;">Following a successful live auction, the online auction continues through Feb. 13, 2019, on NameJet.com</h6>
                                    <p>JACKSONVILLE, Fl

NameJet.com, a Web.com Group, Inc. company, and RightOfTheDot recently held a record-setting live domain name auction at NamesCon 2019 in Las Vegas that generated $2.3 million in sales and a 69 percent sell-through rate.

“I’ve been running domain auctions for more than 20 years, and this was one of the best lists of premium names I’ve ever put together or seen in a live auction,” said Monte Cahn, RightOfTheDot’s president and managing director.Held Monday, Jan. 28, 2019, the auction marked the fourth consecutive year that the two companies have partnered for such a successful event. This also marks the second consecutive year in which record-setting results have been earned.

In 2018, the auction resulted in the highest sales in NameJet history with “SUPER.COM” selling for a record-breaking $1.2 million and “Great.com” selling for $900K. The 2019 auction surpassed 2018 sales and tied for second in NameJet’s best sales to date with OL.com selling for $900K, Leads.com selling for $435K and DomainNames.com selling for $370K.

NameJet was recently acquired by Web.com®, which also operates Network Solutions®, Register.com® and SnapNames®.

“Being a part of Web.com’s domain aftermarket family brought a new energy to this year’s live auction,” said Jonathan Tenenbaum, NameJet’s general manager. “Network Solutions has a customer base with a legacy of nearly 30 years, and that enabled us to include some premium names that were not readily available in the past.”

Of the over 600 domain names listed, 132 were selected for the live auction at NamesCon 2019 in Las Vegas. The remaining names, along with those that did not meet reserve in the live auction, are still available for the ongoing online auction that ends Feb. 13.

There are super-premium names that have six-figure bids and premium top-level domains, including “cpu.com,” “hero.com,” “texasholdem,” “or.net,” “fm.co,” “x.de,” “xu.com,” “willyoumarry.me,” “broker.com,” “bride.com,” “uno.com,” “drone.com,” baja.com,” “piano.com,” and many more. A NameJet account is required to participate in this premium online auction. Bids for domains may be placed now on the NameJet website.
